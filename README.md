# Huffman Coding Compression Tool

This project implements Huffman Coding, an efficient algorithm for lossless data compression. Huffman Coding reduces file size by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters in the data, making storage and transmission more efficient.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Compress text and binary files using Huffman Coding, significantly reducing their size without losing information.
- **Decoding**: Restore compressed files to their original state by decoding Huffman-encoded data.
- **Customizable Input**: Supports files of various formats for compression and decompression.
- **Performance**: Efficiently generates Huffman trees and codes, with fast encoding/decoding processes.
- **CLI Tools**: Includes command-line utilities for easy file compression and decompression.
- **Educational Examples**: Demonstrates the step-by-step process of building Huffman trees, assigning codes, and performing compression.

## How Huffman Coding Works

Huffman Coding analyzes the frequency of each character in the input data. More frequent characters are assigned shorter binary codes, while less frequent characters receive longer codes. This ensures that the overall file size is minimized. The process involves:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Calculate how often each character appears in the data.
2. **Tree Construction**: Build a binary tree (Huffman Tree) based on character frequencies.
3. **Code Assignment**: Generate binary codes for each character by traversing the tree.
4. **Encoding**: Replace each character in the file with its corresponding binary code.
5. **Decoding**: Use the Huffman Tree to translate binary codes back into the original characters.
